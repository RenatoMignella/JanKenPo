- Tried invalid inputs 
- Tested on Heroku and the Terminal.

  #### Bugs

-  Solved Bugs
   - Validation problem
 

  #### Remain Bugs

- No remain Bugs 

 #### Validator Testing 
 - [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
   - Initially found few errors that where fixed only 2 Warnings left
 #### Deployment 
- When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:

   - heroku/python
    - heroku/nodejs
    - You must then create a Config Var called - PORT. Set this to 8000

    
  -  Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
